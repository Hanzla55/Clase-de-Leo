  # WHAT IS A LASER                                       
                                          
It is an optical device that launches a beam of thermal light that cuts on objects, 


depending on the object, it uses more energy to make a stronger cut, to cut or burn an object


and create the shape of what we want to do at that moment.


It can be used on many objects of different durability to which the strength of the laser is adapted.


# What have I learned and what have I done?

 I have learned how it works, the utilities it has and that can help you a lot.
 

I have made designs in Inkscape for decorating objects, customizing and creating objects.



### WHAT IS ONSHAPE?

Oneshape is a program to make 3D designs and create objects also to modify


projects already done by other people and adapt it to your needs. It can be 


very helpful because you can create parts for machines, instruments to your measurements.


# What have I learned and what have I done?


I have learned how to use the software 


to make different types of objects 


and later we can also 3D print that 

objects in the 3d printing machine.


### HERE ARE SOME IMAGES THAT I MADE USING INKSCAPE
